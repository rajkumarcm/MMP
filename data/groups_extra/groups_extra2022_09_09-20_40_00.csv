Zarqawi¬¨√≠s militants became a major participant in the Iraqi insurgency during the American occupation, first under the name Jama¬¨√≠at al-Tawhid wa¬¨√≠al-Jihad and then, after swearing fealty to Al Qaeda, as Al Qaeda in Iraq. Facing backlash from the community and increased security from U.S. and Iraqi forces, the group faced decline until 2011, when it began to grow through its involvement in the Syrian Civil War. In 2013, it changed its name to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Over the course of 2013 and 2014, it quickly took over territory in Syria and Iraq. In addition to its rapid expansion, ISIS has also drawn attention for its public beheadings of Western captives and its large contingent of foreign fighters. On the ground, IS has fought Syrian government forces, Syrian rebel groups, the Iraqi military and militias, and the Kurdish peshmerga.

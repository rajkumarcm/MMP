433,Zain Group,https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/mappingmilitants/profiles/zain-group,"Also known as Abdullah Mehsud group. Qari Zainuddin Mehsud split from Baitullah Mehsud¬ís Tehrik-i-Taliban-aligned group in 2007, following the death of his TTP-affiliated cousin Abdullah Mehsud. Zain blamed Baitullah for the death of his cousin as well as several other family members. Zain led his anti-Baitullah, pro-government splinter group in what has been called a ¬ìblood feud¬î with this rival TTP group. Zain¬ís group, estimated between 700 and 3,000 strong, is based in the KP province but seeks to fight Baitullah¬ís forces in South Waziristan. Zain¬ís group accepted help from the Pakistani government, which was also seeking to defeat Baitullah. Zain was assassinated on June 23, 2009 by a trusted guard loyal to Baitullah. Baitullah¬ís forces in the TTP have claimed responsibility. Since Zain¬ís death, Misbahuddin Mehsud (Toofas Mehsud) is the new leader, and has reaffirmed the fight against Baitullah as well as claimed support for Taliban militants in Afghanistan fighting jihad against the US forces, particularly for Mullah Omar.","The Zain Group is a Pakistani militant organization, which formed as a splinter from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan in 2007.",04/00/2017,2007,0,1,1,1,06/00/2009,06/00/2009,700,2009,700,2009,3000,2009,,South Waziristan ,Pakistan,,0,0,0,,0,,maybe Pakistan should be coded as state sponsor?
